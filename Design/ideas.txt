Gradient for wind



*IMPORTANT* 


Lift ~ relativeVel^2 * angleOfAttack


Lift is always proportional to the aot. Of speed is const and aot doubles, then lift is also doubled. 
If aot is too big it will stall. About 20°. 



Brakes are not only for increasing drag on one side, but for changing the angle of attack of the glider. 
Therefore, the force applied should be at the trailing edge of the glider.
